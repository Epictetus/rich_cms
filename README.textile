h1. Rich-CMS

A Rails gem (and also plugin) for a pluggable CMS frontend

h2. Introduction

Rich-CMS is a module of E9s ("http://github.com/archan937/e9s":http://github.com/archan937/e9s) which provides a frontend for your CMS content.

h2. Installation

h3. Using Rich-CMS as gem

Install the Rich-CMS gem:

<pre>
  sudo gem install rich_cms
</pre>

Add rich_cms in @environment.rb@ as a gem dependency:

<pre>
  config.gem "rich_cms"
</pre>

h3. Using Rich-CMS as plugin

Install the Rich-CMS plugin:

<pre>
  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/archan937/rich_cms.git 
</pre>

h2. Use the provided Rails generators

Rich-CMS requires two entities:

* An @Authlogic@ authenticated user model
* An @ActiveRecord@ model used for CMS content storage

Fortunately, Rich-CMS is provided with two Rails generators with which you can generate both entities.

h3. Authlogic user

Run the following in your console:

<pre>
  script/generate rich_authlogic_user
</pre>

*Note*: At default, it will create both the @User@ and @UserSesson@ classes and @CreateUsers@ migration. You can alter the class names with the following:

<pre>
  script/generate rich_authlogic_user CodeHeroes::User --migrate
</pre>

*Note*: Both generators have the @-m@ or @--migrate@ option which runs @rake db:migrate@ after creating the files.

h3. CMS content

Run the following in your console:

<pre>
  script/generate rich_cms_content
</pre>

*Note*: At default, it will create the @CmsContent@ model and @CreateCmsContents@ migration. You can alter the class name with the following:

<pre>
  script/generate rich_cms_content CmsItem
</pre>

In case you have used the Rails generators, you can skip the *Create required entities manually* section and go straight to *Render Rich-CMS in your views*.

h2. Create required entities manually

h3. Specify the authentication mechanism

Provide the mechanism as a symbol (e.g. @:authlogic@) and the authenticated class along with the attribute used to identify the instance in a hash.

<pre>
  Rich::Cms::Engine.authenticate(:authlogic, {:class_name => "User", :identifier => :email})
</pre>      

Unfortunately, only AuthLogic ("http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic":http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic) is supported, but we are working hard on making Rich-CMS compatible with other mechanisms.

h3. Register CMS content

Every type of content is identified with its correspending CSS selector (used by the jQuery based Javascript module of Rich-CMS). You will have to provide some specifications:

* @:class_name@ - The class of the CMS content model which contain the data

The following specifications are optional as Rich-Cms uses defaults:

* @:key@ (default: @:key@) - The key used for identification of content. You can also provide an array for a combined key (e.g. @[:key, :locale]@)
* @:value@ (default: @:value@) - The attribute which stores the value of the content instance.
* @:tag@ (default: @:span@) - The tag used for content items.
* @:add@ (default: @[]@) - An array of the content item attributes included within the HTML attributes.
* @:before_edit@ (default: @nil@) - Javascript function called before showing the edit form of a content item
* @:after_update@ (default: @Rich.Cms.Editor.afterUpdate@) - Javascript function called after update a content item

<pre>
  Rich::Cms::Engine.register(".cms_content", {:class_name => "Cms::StaticContent"})
  Rich::Cms::Engine.register(".i18n"       , {:class_name => "Translation", :key => [:key, :locale], :before_edit => "Rich.I18n.beforeEdit", :after_update => "Rich.I18n.afterUpdate"})
</pre>

h2. Render Rich-CMS in your views

h3. Alter your layout

Add the following line at the beginning of the @<body>@ tag:

<pre>
  <body>
    <%= rich_cms %>
    ...
  </body>
</pre>

h3. Use the Rich-CMS helper method

Rich-CMS requires a rendered DOM element provided with meta data of the content instance. Fortunately, you can call a method provided by Rich-CMS. Just specify the identifier of the content type and the key of the CMS content instance in question:

<pre>
  >> key = "test_content"
  => "test_content"
  >> Rich::Cms::Engine.to_content_tag(".cms_content", key)
  => "<div class='cms_content' data-key='test_content' data-value='Hello world!'>Hello world!</div>"
</pre>

When using a combined key for content identification, just call it as follows:

<pre>
  >> Rich::Cms::Engine.to_content_tag(".cms_content", {:key => key, :locale => I18n.locale})
  => "<div class='cms_content' data-key='test_content' data-locale='nl' data-value='Hallo wereld!'>Hallo wereld!</div>"
</pre>

*Note*: In this case, the content was registered with @Rich::Cms::Engine.register(".cms_content", {:class_name => "Cms::StaticContent", :key => [:key, :locale]})@

We have also provided you a helper method to render Rich-CMS content tags:

<pre>
  ...
  <%= rich_cms_tag ".cms_content", "test_content" %>
  <%= rich_cms_tag ".cms_content", {:key => "test_content", :locale => I18n.locale} %>
  ...
</pre>

h3. Rich-CMS in your browser

Open "http://localhost:3000/cms":http://localhost:3000/cms, log in and start managing CMS content.

h2. Customizing the after update implementation

The @update@ action response of @Rich::CmsController@ is provided with "JSON":http://www.json.org data regarding the updated content item. The response will be passed to the @after_update@ Javascript function. Its default JSON data:

<pre>
  {"__selector__": ".cms_content", "__identifier__": {"key": "test_paragraph"}, "value": "Hello world!"}
</pre>

*Note*: @__selector__@ and @__identifier__@ are *always* provided in the JSON data.

When specifying a custom after update Javascript function, you probably want to acquire more information than provided in the default JSON data. You can customize this by defining the @to_rich_cms_response@ method in the CMS content model class:

<pre>
  class Translation < ActiveRecord::Base
  
    def to_rich_cms_response(params)
      {:value => value, :translations => Hash[*params[:derivative_keys].split(";").uniq.collect{|x| [x, x.t]}.flatten]}
    end
  
  end
</pre>

The JSON data provided will be look like:

<pre>
  {"__selector__": ".i18n", "__identifier__": {"locale": "nl", "key": "word.user"}, "value": "gebruiker", "translations": {"users": "gebruikers"}}
</pre>

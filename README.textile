h1. Rich-CMS

A Rails gem (and also plugin) for a pluggable CMS frontend

h2. Introduction

Rich-CMS is a module of E9s ("http://github.com/archan937/e9s":http://github.com/archan937/e9s) which provides a frontend for your CMS content.

h2. Installation

h3. Using Rich-CMS as gem

Install the Rich-CMS gem:

<pre>
  sudo gem install rich_cms
</pre>

Add rich_cms in @environment.rb@ as a gem dependency:

<pre>
  config.gem "rich_cms"
</pre>

h3. Using Rich-CMS as plugin

Install the Rich-CMS plugin:

<pre>
  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/archan937/rich_cms.git 
</pre>

h2. Usage

h3. Specify the authentication mechanism

Provide the mechanism as a symbol (e.g. @:authlogic@) and the authenticated class along with the attribute used to identify the instance in a hash.

<pre>
  Rich::Cms::Engine.authenticate(:authlogic, {:class => Betty::User, :identifier => :name})
</pre>      

Unfortunately, only AuthLogic ("http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic":http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic) is supported, but we are working hard on making Rich-CMS compatible with other mechanisms.

h3. Register CMS content

Every type of content is identified with its correspending CSS selector (used by the jQuery based Javascript module of Rich-CMS). You will have to provide some specifications:

* @:class@ - The class of the CMS content model which contain the data
* @:key@ (optional) - The attribute used for identification of the content instance (which at default is @:key@). You can also provide an array for a combined key (e.g. @[:key, :locale]@)
* @:value@ (optional) - The attribute which stores the value of the content instance (which at default is @:value@).

<pre>
  Rich::Cms::Engine.register(".betty_cms_content", {:class => Betty::Cms::StaticContent})
</pre>

h3. Render Rich-CMS content within your views

Rich-CMS requires a rendered DOM element provided with meta data of the content instance. Fortunately, you can call a method provided by Rich-CMS. Just specify the identifier of the content type and the key of the CMS content instance in question:

<pre>
  >> key = "test_content"
  => "test_content"
  >> Rich::Cms::Engine.to_content_tag({".betty_cms_content" => key})
  => "<div class='betty_cms_content' data-key='test_content' data-value='Hello world!'>Hello world!</div>"
</pre>
